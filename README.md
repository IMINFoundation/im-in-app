# im-in-app# I'M IN Foundation - Open Source Project

## Welcome!
Aloha! The "I'M IN" Foundation is a Hawaii-based startup building an app to make giving simple, fun, and impactful. Our mission: **"Promote Global Prosperity with Philanthropy"**. We’re open-sourcing this project to harness the brilliance of Oahu’s tech talent—students, teachers, and developers—to create a platform where anyone can donate, volunteer, or launch social enterprises for good. Join us to turn "I'M IN" into a global movement—starting right here in Hawaii!

## About the Project
"I'M IN" is a mobile app that:
- Lets users donate money, goods, or time in one sleek hub.
- Tracks personal impact in real time.
- Spins up custom apps for social enterprises tackling climate action and jobs.
- Hooks Gen Z with gamification and viral #IMinChallenges.

Here’s a sneak peek at what we’re building:

We’re self-funded via a 5% transaction fee, but we need *you* to build the MVP—think donation flows, impact dashboards, and an app builder skeleton. Check out our [Summary](#) (coming soon) for the full vision!

## How to Get Involved
- **Students & Teachers:** Oahu’s schools—UH Manoa, HCC, LCC, HTA, Kamehameha, Kalani, Waipahu, ‘Iolani, Maryknoll, and Punahou—are our backbone. Code a feature, test with your class, or mentor peers!
- **Developers:** Fork this repo, pick an [issue](#issues), and submit a pull request (PR).
- **Ideas:** Open an issue to suggest features (e.g., "Add volunteering sign-up").

### Tech Stack (Proposed)
- **Frontend:** React Native (mobile-first, cross-platform).
- **Backend:** Node.js + Firebase (scalable, low-cost).
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), open-source libs.

### Getting Started
1. **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/im-in-foundation/im-in-app.git`
2. **Install:** `npm install` (or yarn).
3. **Run:** `npm start` (details in progress—help us fill this in!).
4. **Contribute:** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](#) (TBD).

## Current Goals
- Build core features: donations, impact tracking, app builder.
- Launch an MVP by Fall 2025.
- Test in Kailua with local schools and users.
